A Book Management System in a Spring Boot project is an application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books in a library or book store context. This system can be designed to manage books, authors, categories, and user interactions like borrowing or purchasing books, viewing details, and searching for books.
